Project Description: Pomodoro Tasks
This is a task management application with integrated Pomodoro tracking. The to-do list is fully operational, allowing users to create, edit, and delete tasks. Task data is handled by a Supabase backend.

The dashboard includes a chatbot feature that is connected to an n8n workflow. This allows users to send messages to manage their tasks.

During the setup for the WhatsApp integration, I ran into a persistent issue where the Evolution API service could not connect to its Redis dependency. I attempted several troubleshooting steps, including checking Docker networking, verifying environment variables, and recreating containers, but I was ultimately unable to establish a stable connection. As a result, the WhatsApp feature is not currently functional.
